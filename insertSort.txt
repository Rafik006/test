[8,20,-2,4,-6]


let i=1 arr[i] numberToInsert =20

let j=i-1  arr[j] =>8 
[8,20,-2,4,-6]

arr[j+1]=numberToInsert    means arr[1]=numberToInsert => 20

//
i=2 arr[i] numberToInsert =-2

j=i-1=>1  arr[j] =>20
since arr[j] => 20 >numberToInsert => -2

arr[j+1] =>arr[2] =arr[j]
[8,20,20,4,-6]
j=j-1 => means j=0 

since arr[j]=>8 >numberToInsert => -2
arr[j+1]=arr[j]
[8,8,20,4,-6]

and then out of the while loop 
then we have j=-1
arr[j+1]=numberToInsert
